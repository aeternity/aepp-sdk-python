Interacting with a contract
===========================

This guide describes how you can leverage aepp-sdk interact
with a deployed aeternity smart contract.

.. seealso:: Sophia: An Ã†ternity Blockchain Language

                The Sophia is a language in the ML family.
                It is strongly typed and has restricted mutable state.
                Check out more about sophia `here <https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/sophia.md>`_.


Prerequisites
=============

1. An account with some initial AE
2. An address/contract_id of a deployed contract
3. An aeternity node
4. A sophia aehttp compiler

.. admonition:: Assumptions

                We're going to assume that you have working knowledge of the SDK and
                know how to create an Account instance, a NodeClient, and a CompilerClient.


Sample Sophia Contract
======================

Below is the sample sophia contract that we'll use in this guide.

We need to import the following classes to use contracts.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 11-14


Initializing NodeClient and Compiler
====================================

Below are the steps required to initialize the `NodeClient` and `Compiler`.
As you can see below, during the initialization of `NodeClient` we're also providing the `internal_url`. 

`internal_url` provides the debug endpoint to `dry_run` a contract method which 
can also be used to do static calls on deployed contracts and this is what exactly we're going to use this for.

You can also not provide the `internal_url` but then you'll have to disable the use of `dry-run` endpoint.
We'll see how to do that when we initialize our contract.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 18-28

Generate an Account
=====================

You'll need an account (using the `Account` class) for stateful contract calls.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 32-33
   :dedent: 4

Read the Contract from file and initialize
==========================================

You can read the contract from the stored `.aes` file and use it to initialize the contract instance.
If you have not provided the `internal_endpoint` or simple do not want to use the `dry-run` functionality
you can disable it by passing `use-dry-run=False` to the `ContractNative` constructor.

.. warning::
                If you DO NOT provide the `internal_url` during NodeClient initialization
                and also DID NOT disable the `dry-run` then the contract method calls for
                `un-stateful` methods WILL FAIL.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 37-52
   :dedent: 4

Now pass the address of the deployed contract

.. warning::
                If the contract is not found at the provided address and for
                the given network, the method will fail

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 62-63
   :dedent: 4


Call the contract methods
=========================

All the methods inside the contract are also available (with same signature)
to use from the contract instance.

.. note:: 
                All the methods that are NOT `stateful`, by default are processed using the `dry-run` endpoint to save gas.
                And therefore, a transaction hash will also not be provided for them.
                This functionality can be either diabled for the contract instance or per method by using `use_dry_run` argument.


.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 65-69
   :dedent: 4


And in a similar way a not stateful call can be invoked 

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/test_tutorial05-contracts.py
   :lines: 73-77
