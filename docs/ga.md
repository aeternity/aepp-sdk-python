# Generalized Accounts

This page describe how to use the Python SDK to convert a basic account to a generalized one.
For additional information about genrealized accounts visit the [documentation](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/generalized_accounts/ga_explained.md).



## Example

The following example describe how to transform a basic account to a generalized one and
how to execute a spend transaction from a generalized account.


```python
from aeternity.node import NodeClient, Config
from aeternity.signing import Account
from aeternity.transactions import TxBuilder
from aeternity.contract import CompilerClient
from aeternity import defaults, hashing, utils

import requests



def top_up_account(account_address):

    print()
    print(f"top up account {account_address} using the testnet.faucet.aepps.com app")
    r = requests.post(f"https://testnet.faucet.aepps.com/account/{account_address}").json()
    tx_hash = r.get("tx_hash")
    balance = utils.format_amount(r.get("balance"))
    print(f"account {account_address} has now a balance of {balance}")
    print(f"faucet transaction hash {tx_hash}")
    print()
